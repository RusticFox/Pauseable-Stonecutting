Is your stonecutting bull taking too long? Are you hunry, tired? don't want to lose all the progress you made on the bill?
Look no further than Pauseable Stonecutting! Start cutting stone take a break! and come back when you have time and continue where you left off!

Yes! The unfinished texture is one of the old stonechuncks. People who played rimworld for a long time will remember them.
